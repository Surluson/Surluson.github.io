Born in Reykjavik, Iceland (1992)  
**B.Sc. in Chemistry from University of Iceland (2012-2015)**  
Moved to Corvallis Oregon (2016)  
**Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from University of Iceland (2016-2020)**  
Moved to Reykjavik, Iceland again (2021)  


Along the way I was lucky enough to get a Graduate Teaching Assistantship (GTA) at OSU,  
and a Graduate Research Assistantship (GRA) at [Dr. Cory Simon's lab at Oregon State](https://simonensemble.github.io).

My research was centered around *in silico* studies on porous materials, including zeolites, porous-organic cages, and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).
My publishing history can be seen on my resume above, but the papers I published mainly explored niche ways to understand and explain certain aspects of porous materials, such as their geometry.
The tools I used for that exploration includes:  
* Matrix Decomposition Methods (such as the SVD)  
* Graph Neural Networks  
* Recommender Systems  
* Autoencoders
